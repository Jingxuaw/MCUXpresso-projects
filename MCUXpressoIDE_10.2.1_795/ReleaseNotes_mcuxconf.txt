  - Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, 17.04 Linux-hosted variants of tools are distributed on Linux as 64-bit binaries, which may not work 
    on 32-bit systems. Supported desktop environments: GNOME
  - Mac OS X operating system (10.12 Sierra, 10.13 High Sierra or later)
- 4GB RAM or more
- Display with resolution 1024 x 768 or more
- Internet connection for dynamic download of processor database

System Requirements for the Web Version
======================================
- Internet browser with JavaScript enabled
  - Required versions of web browser: IE 9+, Safari 5.1+, Firefox 33+, and Chrome 38+
- Internet connection for dynamic download of processor database 
- Display with resolution 1024 x 768 or more

Known Issues and Limitations
============================
* General
  - It's not possible to import a C file with configuration for Pins and Clocks tools into previous versions (2.0 and below)
  - Cut, Paste and Delete commands may not work properly when selected from Edit menu.
  - After detaching all visible windows (views) of any tool to a second monitor all these views might disappear. Menu commands from Views menu might be also affected. 
	Workaround: Delete "user_home/.nxp/" directory. Note that - this will also reset your preferences.
  - [Ubuntu] On Ubuntu 14.04, when starting the Tools from the command line, you must enter: export ''UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0" before 
    running the Tools. Otherwise, after selecting Tools from the menu, the start will unexpectedly fail.
  - [Linux/KDE] - There is a bug in some version of GTK causing Tools to crash when switching between tabs. 
    Workaround: Edit the file /usr/share/themes/oxygen-gtk/gtk-2.0/gtkrc and change `GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 1` into `GtkComboBox::appears-as-list = 0`
  - [Linux/KDE] - Issue in KDE themes (one example: http://askubuntu.com/questions/545951/text-color-sometimes-unreadable-in-elegance-kde-desktop-theme)
    Workaround: Use a different theme, or reset to default System settings -> Application Style. 
  - [Linux/KDE] - Links (from Help) don't work on Kubuntu. 
    Workaround: For Ubuntu KDE you may have to install an additional library "libgnomeui-0". Run: apt install libgnomeui-0 from the command line.
  - [Safari] Web version of the tool might freeze when using Safari browser. Recommended workaround: Use another browser or the desktop version. 
  - [MacOS] When you exit the Tools by clicking the "x" button in upper-right corner, you will receive the following error: MCUXpresso Config Tools quit unexpectedly. 
    The error is caused by JVM.
  - [MacOS] Some of the main tool menu items are shown in English even if the locale is set to Chinese.
* Pins tool
  - Tooltips in Target processor view and in drop down menus are not supported in web version.
  - Hotkey for Delete row in routed pins view is missing in web version.
  - Package view blinks in the web version.
  - [Ubuntu] Horizontal scrollbars in Peripheral and Pins view and in Routed pins table are missing on some Linux systems.
* Clocks tool 
  - When multiple outputs have frequency locks and an error is found, the error is reported for all the locks that are fed from the same clock source
* Peripherals tool
  - Only certain drivers and processors are supported, see MCUXpresso Config Tools website for more details  

Kinetis Specific Issues:
* UART/FTM modulation functionality is covered by not clear special signals of System Integration Module. 
  This feature will be better designed by the peripheral modes in the next release.
* [MKM34] Potential errors in the Route to selection are not correct for multipath connections.

Desktop installer:
* The tool will not work when the installation path contains following characters "!@#$%^&". This is a Java limitation 
  and mentioned characters are invalid for Java - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3109.
* [Ubuntu/Debian] For reinstalling the tool using dpkg first uninstall the tool and then install again.
